Hi!

The WebView control will be replaced with [WebView2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/hosting/webview2).

If you have additional feedback on scenarios that need to be covered, please feel free to engage directly with the Edge team [here](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebViewFeedback).

Thanks!
